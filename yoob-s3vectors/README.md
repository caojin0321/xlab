# yoob AWS S3Vectors integration
This crate integrates AWS S3Vectors into yoob, allowing you to easily use RAG with AWS' newest offering.

## Installation
To install this crate, run the following command in a Rust project directory which will add `yoob-surrealdb` as a dependency (requires `yoob-core` added for intended usage):
```bash
cargo add yoob-s3vectors
```

This integration will require that you have an AWS account, although the region does not matter.
