# xlab-Qdrant
Vector store index integration for [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/). This integration supports dense vector retrieval using xlab's embedding providers. It is also extensible to allow all [hybrid queries](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/hybrid-queries/) supported by Qdrant.

You can find end-to-end examples [here](https://github.com/caojin0321/xlab/tree/main/xlab-qdrant/examples).
